Genre Prediction: Final project for Data Mining and Machine Learning

This investigation is focused on the ability to predict a songâ€™s genre based on a series of attributes that are thought to define a song. Country and Rock music share many attributes and being able to accurately identify one over the other is highly important when providing the listener with music that matches their preferences. Though my analysis focuses only on two of the available genres, it can be expanded to evaluate other genres. The data scientists at Spotify (in this case) that create music selection algorithms will be particularly interested in the answer to this question.  Being able to tweak and improve their predictive methods to drive a highly accurate, personalized recommendations is highly attractive for Spotify listeners. The differentiation of closely related genres can be particularly beneficial, which is the focus of this study.

The final model can performed with an accuracy of 82.19%. The model is sufficiently accurate to be used on new data, especially given the context of the problem.  This model is used for predicting music, not diagnosing a disease, so 82% accuracy is perfectly fine.
